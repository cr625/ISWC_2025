\begin{abstract}
We present a framework for integrating ontological knowledge into the decision-making processes of large language models (LLMs) using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a structured communication layer. The prototype application service provides an ontology service grounded in the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), extended through intermediate, application-specific ontologies that define roles, conditions, resources, actions, events, and capabilities. These intermediate ontologies vary according to the guidelines and standardized knowledge available for different domains. In one example, the ProEthica application structures a role-based decision-making environment where agents act under defined constraints and are required to act according to professional standards. In another example, the A-Proxy application applies a distinct ontology to simulate persona-driven Web and chat interactions. In both cases, the ontology service transmits structured context to LLMs and supports external reasoning using ontology-related APIs, allowing results from formal inference processes to be incorporated into the conversational context. This approach enables the integration of symbolic semantic structures with the behavior of statistical models, providing a method for aligning LLM outputs with formally defined knowledge.
