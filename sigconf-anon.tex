\begin{abstract}
We present a novel Model Context Protocol (MCP) service that enables structured ontological knowledge integration with Large Language Models (LLMs). This framework addresses the challenge of providing LLMs with formalized domain-specific knowledge through a dedicated ontology service built on the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). Our approach provides two key components: (1) an agent module that facilitates communication between LLMs and ontological structures through standardized interfaces, and (2) an ontology MCP server that represents semantic knowledge as RDF triples with persistent Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) and supports dynamic content negotiation. The system further enables temporal reasoning by extending RDF structures to represent ordered sequences of events, facilitating causal trace construction (without asserting the underlying causality). Through implementation in two applications \textit{ProEthica} \footnote{ProEthica, available at \url{https://github.com/cr625/ai-ethical-dm/}}
 and \textit{A-Proxy}\footnote{A-Proxy, available at \url{https://github.com/savingads/a-proxy}}
We demonstrate how this service can enhance structured knowledge integration across different domains. Empirical evaluation shows significant improvements in knowledge integration, reasoning consistency, and alignment with domain-specific requirements compared to unstructured approaches. Our framework contributes a generalizable method for bridging symbolic knowledge representation with statistical language models, with implications for semantic web applications, AI alignment, and domain-specific reasoning systems.
